## Checklist
### Must
_(WIP)_: "Work in Progress"

- [x] The code base is stored in source control system on GitHub from early start of the project (the teacher should be able to track the history of the project from the creation of the very first file).

- [x] The system is set up with automatic build script.

- [x] The build script runs all unit tests.

- [x] The output is a deployable or executable artifact, such as a jar/war or equivalent.

- [x] The build script has deploy/install target that deploys the executable outside of the working directory or on external server.

- [ ] _(WIP)_ The business logic should be coded using Test Driven Development.

### Extra
- [ ] _(WIP)_ Integrate database. (0,5 point)
